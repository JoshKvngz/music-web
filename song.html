    <div class="lyrics">
        (Verse 1)
Yeah, I been climbin' up a mountain no one sees but me
Tryna paint a picture of the man I wanna be
Got dreams in my pocket and hope in my chest
Took the long road here, now I’m feelin' blessed

Told my mama, “One day I’ma light up the sky”
Even if I fall, I was born to try
Gotta write my story, leave it in the stars
So when I’m gone, you remember who I are

(Pre-Chorus)
They said it’s too big, they said I won't last
But I broke through walls, left doubt in the past
I ain’t made it yet, but I’m on that track
Lookin’ forward—ain’t never lookin’ back

(Chorus)
If I leave my light, will you carry it on?
When the nights get cold, will you sing my song?
I just wanna leave something they can feel
So they know my heart was always real
Yeah, I just wanna leave my light
I just wanna leave my light

(Verse 2)
I remember sittin’ in a dorm with a pen
Dreamin' 'bout stages I ain’t seen yet then
Now I'm standin’ here, and the lights are bright
And I’m tryna hold on to this feelin’ tight

I ain't perfect, but I'm true to my name
Learned from the losses, danced in the rain
And if I touch one soul, that’s more than fame
'Cause I came to inspire, not just entertain

(Pre-Chorus)
They said it’s too hard, they said to play small
But I see big things when I dream at all
I’ma keep goin’ even if I crawl
I was made to rise, I was born to brawl

(Chorus)
If I leave my light, will you carry it on?
When the nights get cold, will you sing my song?
I just wanna leave something they can feel
So they know my heart was always real
Yeah, I just wanna leave my light
I just wanna leave my light

(Bridge – spoken softly)
This ain’t just about me
It’s for the ones who’ve been told they can’t
The ones who feel invisible
You’re not... you’re powerful

(Final Chorus – more intense)
If I leave my light, will you carry it on?
When the nights get cold, will you sing my song?
I just wanna leave something they can feel
So they know my heart was always real
Yeah, I just wanna leave my light
Let me leave my light
Let me leave my li-i-ight...
